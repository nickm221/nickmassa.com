It is incredibly easy to setup and host a static website using Github.  In order to setup a basic web page, create a new repository and create a branch called "gh-pages".  Add the HTML and CSS files for the site that you will be hosting to this repository.  Switch to the Settings tab and scroll down until you see the GitHub Pages tab.  Within this tab, ensure that the source is set to the gh-pages repository, and enter your domain name.  Once the settings are complete on the Github side, you may need to make some slight adjustments to your DNS settings.
