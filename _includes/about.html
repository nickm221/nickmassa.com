    <p>My name is Nick Massa, and I attended Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey in pursuit of a bachelor’s degree in Cybersecurity and a master’s degree in Computer Science.  I have a deep interest in software development, network security, penetration testing, and improving organizations' security programs. In my free time, I enjoy spending time outside fishing, kayaking, hiking, and camping.  Since graduating, I began my career as an Information Security Consultant at Sungard Availability Services, where I obtained my Associate of (ISC)2 certification. Due to my eagerness to take on new responsibilities and the quality of my work, I was promoted to the role of Senior Security Consultant.</p>
