    <p>My name is Nicholas Massa, and I attended Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey in pursuit of a bachelor’s degree in Cybersecurity and a master’s degree in Computer Science.  I have a deep interest in software development, network security, penetration testing, and digital forensics. In my free time I enjoy spending time outside fishing, kayaking, hiking, and camping.  Since graduating in May of 2017, I have begun my career as an Information Security Consultant at Sungard Availability Services, and I have obtained my Associate of (ISC)2.</p>
